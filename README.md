# "Dice to Distribution" source code

This repository holds the http://www.d8uv.org/dice-to-distribution/source code for my [Dice to Distribution](http://www.d8uv.org/dice-to-distribution/) essay.

I'm putting this up more as a backup for me, I doubt anyone will ever care. In case you do care, feel free to give pull requests if I fucked anything up. This is a personal project for a fancy essay, I tried to do most things properly, but I didn't care to do absolutely everything properly.
